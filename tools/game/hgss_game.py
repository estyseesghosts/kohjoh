"""Build the HeartGold/SoulSilver game sources with GCC, then try to link.

Usage (inside the dev container, after tools/bootstrap.py):

    python3 tools/hgss_game.py --target host32 --keep-going --out /work/out/game1
    python3 tools/hgss_game.py --target 3ds    --keep-going --out /work/out/game1
    python3 tools/hgss_game.py --game soulsilver --target 3ds --out /work/out/ss

`--game` selects the decomp's HEARTGOLD (the default) or SOULSILVER define and
names the program accordingly (pokeheartgold-3ds.elf vs pokesoulsilver-3ds.elf;
the packaged .3dsx drops the -3ds). Each variant needs its own --out directory:
the game objects differ, and both programs must not share an object tree.

This is the Phase 2 harness: it compiles the game as the port compiles the
SDK, builds the port's libnitro/libnitrosystem, generates the overlay table
and the Wi-Fi stand-ins, and links pokeheartgold-pc/pokesoulsilver-pc
(host32) or pokeheartgold-3ds.elf/pokesoulsilver-3ds.elf (3ds, through the
libctru/citro3d shell in hgss/game/app/main_3ds.c).

The source lists come from tools/game_sources.py (game src/ C/C++ and the
ARM9 .s data), the overlay ids and table from tools/game_overlays.py, the
generated .naix/msg/fx headers from tools/prepare_game_headers.py, and the
SDK libraries from tools/hgss_nitro.py. Nothing here writes outside --out
and the generated headers under build/upstream (the decomp's build does the
same).

Not every source compiles under GCC yet; --keep-going compiles what it can,
prints the error count per file, then links the objects that were produced
and prints the unresolved symbols. That list is the work queue for the next
slice. The link targets are deliberately named -pc/-3ds.elf, not .3dsx:
packaging (3dsxtool, the SMDH) is Phase 5. Exit status is 0 only when every
object compiled and the link succeeded; 1 means the run reached the link but
there were errors (the useful case).
