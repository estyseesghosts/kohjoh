 * nitro/snd/common/command.h: the ARM9/ARM7 sound command list type.
 *
 * HGSS keeps the structure as a bare `struct SNDCommand` in
 * lib/NitroSDK/include-pokediamond/nitro/SND_command_shared.h (reached via
 * the flat SND_command.h); only this compat header provides the ntrtwl-style
 * SNDCommand typedef, the SND_COMMAND_* flags and the SNDCommandID enum
 * (ntrtwl include/nitro/snd/common/command.h values). Only
 * 3ds_port/nitro/src/port_snd.c includes this path.
 *
 * The flat SND_command.h is deliberately not included: it declares
 * `const struct SNDCommand *SND_RecvCommandReply(u32)`, while NitroSystem's
 * nnsys/snd_internal.h declares the same function as returning `const void *`.
 * Both headers end up in the generated nns_all_headers.c unity file, and two
 * incompatible prototyped declarations are an error. Nothing in the port
 * dereferences struct SNDCommand (port_snd.c queues opaque pointers), so an
 * incomplete struct is enough and leaves the decomp's own declaration as the
 * only one.
