/*
 * The small C++ runtime surface HGSS's lobby references.
 *
 * The lobby is the game's only C++ code (the .cpp files under src/lobby). Metrowerks' C++
 * compiler emitted a handful of runtime helpers next to it; the port builds
 * those same files with GCC, -fno-exceptions and -fno-rtti, and does not link
 * libstdc++ (it would pull a second allocator, exception tables and a
 * different new/delete set into a game that uses neither).
 *
 * The two out-of-line destructors are here as well. MWCC emitted them next to
 * the class definitions (ppw_lobby_update_my_profile.cpp,
 * lobby_event_deque_add_back_capacity.cpp) and the decomp's own build recovers
 * them with tools/object_aliases.py from the .alias-map.json files beside
 * ppw_lobby.cpp and lobby_event_deque_destroy.c: both maps alias the
 * destructor to the C destroy routine at offset 0
 * (`LobbyCharVector_Destroy` / `LobbyEventDeque_Destroy2`). GCC does not emit
 * those destructors, and the alias maps pin MWCC's function sizes, which GCC's
 * larger code does not match, so the two symbols are defined here and the
 * harness skips exactly those two map entries. Calling the same C destroy
 * routine is the aliased behaviour, not an approximation.
 *
 * What remains is the storage surface the lobby uses directly:
 *
 * - `_ZnamRKSt9nothrow_t` is `operator new[](unsigned int, std::nothrow_t
 *   const&)`. lobby_event_vector_assign_range.c calls it through that mangled
 *   C name and checks the result for NULL, so it must return NULL, never
 *   throw or abort. Zero-size requests get one byte, so the result is a unique
 *   non-NULL pointer like a real C++ allocation.
 * - `_ZdaPv` is `operator delete[](void*)`; the matching free.
 * - `_ZNSt15__vector_commonILb1EE18throw_length_errorEv` is MSL's
 *   `std::__vector_common<true>::throw_length_error()`. The port is built with
 *   -fno-exceptions, so there is no exception to throw: print a clear message
 *   and abort. The lobby's growth routines call it only when a capacity
 *   computation would overflow, which is a programming error, not a game
 *   state.
 * - `_ZSt7nothrow` is `std::nothrow`; the game declares it `extern char
 *   _ZSt7nothrow[]` and only passes its address, so one byte suffices.
 *
 * These are program objects (tools/hgss_game.py app_sources), not archive
 * members: they must only exist in the linked program, next to the game code
 * that calls the mangled names.
